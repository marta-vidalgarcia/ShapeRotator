\title{match.datasets}
\usage{
match.datasets(data.1, data.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.1}{an object of the class "array" that contains three-dimensional
landmarks for structure #1 (e.g. skull)}

\item{data.2}{an object of the class "array" that contains three-dimensional
landmarks for structure #2 (e.g. mandible)}
}
\value{
This function returns a list with the two translated arrays of dimensions
  (p, 3, n), in which dimnames associated with each specimen (n) are in the
  same order.
}
\description{
Matches two arrays by their dimnames
}
\details{
Takes the two translated arrays and joined them by dimnames.
Unmatched datasets (specimens missing in data.1 or data.2) are deleted.
}
\examples{
# We need to match the dimnames of the translated datasets, but we have two
# extra specimens in data.1_t
\dontrun{
length(dimnames(data.1_t)[[3]]) # n=12
length(dimnames(data.2_t)[[3]])  # n=10
matched <- match.datasets(data.1_t, data.2_t)

# When we matched the arrays, only matrices from specimens present in both
# datasets will be kept

length(dimnames(matched$matched1)[[3]]) # n=10

length(dimnames(matched$matched2)[[3]])  # n=10
}

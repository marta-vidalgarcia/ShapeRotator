\description{
Plots the two rotated datasets in 3D
}
\usage{
plot.rotation.3D(joined.data, data.1, data.2, specimen.num)

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data.1}{
an object of the class "array" that contains three-dimensional landmarks for structure #1 (e.g. skull)
}
  \item{data.2}{
an object of the class "array" that contains three-dimensional landmarks for structure #2 (e.g. mandible)
}
  \item{specimen.num}{
an integer object that indicates which specimen will be plotted
}
}

\value{
This function returns a 3D plot of the rotated structures (e.g. mandible and skull).
}

\Details{
Plots the two rotated datasets in 3D for a specimen (specimen.num), and each structure is plotted with a different colour. Default is black and red. This uses the function plot3d (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgl/) internally.
